## HOW TO USE IT

### Adding the library to your project
The aar artifact is available at the **jcenter** repository. Declare the repository and the
dependency in your `build.gradle`.
    
(root)
```groovy
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
```
    
(module)
```groovy    
    dependencies {
        compile 'com.pes.materialcolorpicker:library:1.2.5'
    }
```

### Use the library

Import the class
```java
    import com.pes.androidmaterialcolorpickerdialog.ColorPicker;
```

Create a color picker dialog object

```java
    final ColorPicker cp = new ColorPicker(MainActivity.this, defaultColorR, defaultColorG, defaultColorB);
```

defaultColorR, defaultColorG, defaultColorB are 3 integer (value 0-255) for the initialization of the color picker with your custom color value. If you don't want to start with a color set them to 0 or use only the first argument.

The library also supports alpha values. If no color or only red, green, and blue are specified, the alpha value is set to 255 (0xFF) and no slider is shown.

Use the following constructor to specify an alternative alpha channel value (0..255). As soon as the alpha value constructor is used, a fourth slider will appear above the RGB sliders and the text input field will change from six HEX characters to eight.

```java
    final ColorPicker cp = new ColorPicker(MainActivity.this, defaultAlphaValue, defaultColorR, defaultColorG, defaultColorB);
```


Then show the dialog (when and where you want) and save the selected color

```java
    /* Show color picker dialog */
    cp.show();
    
	cp.enableAutoClose(); // Enable auto-dismiss for the dialog
	
    /* Set a new Listener called when user click "select" */
    cp.setCallback(new ColorPickerCallback() {
        @Override
        public void onColorChosen(@ColorInt int color) {
            // Do whatever you want
	    // Examples
	    Log.d("Alpha", Integer.toString(Color.alpha(color)));
	    Log.d("Red", Integer.toString(Color.red(color)));
	    Log.d("Green", Integer.toString(Color.green(color)));
	    Log.d("Blue", Integer.toString(Color.blue(color)));

	    Log.d("Pure Hex", Integer.toHexString(color));
	    Log.d("#Hex no alpha", String.format("#%06X", (0xFFFFFF & color)));
	    Log.d("#Hex with alpha", String.format("#%08X", (0xFFFFFFFF & color)));
		
		// If the auto-dismiss option is not enable (disabled as default) you have to manually dimiss the dialog
		// cp.dismiss();
        }
    });
```

That's all :)

### Transition from v1.1 to v1.2

The deprecated callback has been removed. See *Transition from v1.0 to v1.1*.

### Transition from v1.0 to v1.1

Version 1.1 introduced some API changes---mainly a renaming of the `OnColorSelected` callback interface. This has been renamed to `ColorPickerCallback`.

The old interface is still in the library but will be removed in the next version update. It has been marked as deprecated and isn't called by the library, therefore no values will appear in your app if you still rely on the old interface.
